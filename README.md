# Transfinite-Interpolation
This code is about the generating in Physical domain of Elliptic using Transfinite Interpolation technique and converting the physical domain into computation domain
# How to run the code.
The code is written in python.
File name is saved in .py format
The code is written using Vscode and the libray used in the code are numpy and matplotlib.
After running the code we get the image of meshgrid  of physical domain and computation domain.
